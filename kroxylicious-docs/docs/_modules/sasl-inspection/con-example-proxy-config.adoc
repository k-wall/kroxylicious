= Example proxy configuration file

[role="_abstract"]
If your instance of the Kroxylicious Proxy runs directly on an operating system, provide the filter configuration in the `filterDefinitions` list of your proxy configuration.

Here's a complete example of a `filterDefinitions` entry configured for Oauth Bearer validation:

.Example `filterDefinitions` configuration
[source, yaml]
----
filterDefinitions:
  - name: my-sasl-inspection-filter
    type: SaslInspectionFilter
    config:
      enabledMechanisms: [ "OAUTHBEARER" ] # <1>
----
<1> The (optional) list of SASL mechanisms that are to be enabled.
Refer to SASL mechanism by its https://www.iana.org/assignments/sasl-mechanisms/sasl-mechanisms.xhtml[IANA registered name].
If omitted, SASL mechanism SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512 and OAUTHBEARER will be enabled by default.

Refer to the {ProxyGuide} for more information about configuring the proxy.
